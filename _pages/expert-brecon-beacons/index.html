| DAY ONE //

    <p class="paragraph--lead">After a cursory glance at the weather forecast, it was clear that our weekend in the Brecon Beacons was going to be typically Welsh - damp and miserable.</p>
    <hr />
    <h4 class="title title--italic title--smaller">Glasbury</h4>
    <p>We set off in the MINI Countryman on Friday night at about 7.30pm, having raided M&S and stocked up for our evening drive to Wales.</p>
    <p>We instantly felt very comfortable in the car and were impressed with all the gadgets. Toby was eager to try out the car first, leaving me on DJ, navigation and picnic duty. We soon realised that my navigation was not needed (much to Toby's relief) as the car’s sat nav was brilliant. </p>
    <p>Just under three hours later we arrived at Foyles of Glasbury, our home for the weekend. We walked into a small, buzzing bar where we were immediately greeted and checked in by the very friendly staff.  I was instantly won over by the exposed brick walls and copper trinkets. The hotel paid homage to the local town Hay-on-Wye - with a wall displaying old typewriters and books - signalling Hay-on-Wye’s literary tradition.</p>

| DAY TWO //

<section class="bg--light-grey">
  <div class="row--thin row--padding">
    <p class="paragraph--lead">We arose Saturday morning to very little sunshine and in preparation for the wind and rain, only a hearty omelette would suffice.</p>
    <p>We had a rough idea of what we wanted to do and see and started planning our route for the day over breakfast. First on the list was the impressive waterfall Sgywd yr Eira, and fittingly, the rain started pouring each and every way - which it continued to do for the rest of our stay! The last couple of miles to the falls included a steep and winding narrow road which left me regretting jumping behind the wheel for this excursion. Rest assured, for the view of the falls, it was all worth it!</p>

    <h4 class="title title--italic title--smaller">Sgywd yr Eira</h4>
    <p>On arrival we put on our walking boots, zipped up our waterproofs and headed off to the falls. We would advise anyone heading to the Beacons to go equipped with these essential two items!</p>
    <p>Reaching the waterfall, after an adventurous walk, was something to behold. The fresh Brecon Beacon spray lashed us, which we found surprisingly refreshing - allowing ourselves, if only for a moment, to take in the cascading falls. I then navigated my way round the rocks in order to try and capture ‘the money shot’. I was able to stand behind the waterfall (where ironically it was rather dry) offering quite a unique experience making you feel like you were in the falls. We then clambered back up the hill which got our hearts ticking and legs burning, and we were soon back in the car with the heated seats turned on high…</p>

    <p>After a busy morning, it was time for a spot of lunch and a well earned (half) pint. The pub we found, The Felin Fach Griffin, had a cozy fireplace and homely sofas, perfect for the unpredictable weather. We moved on through to the restaurant where we were greeted with some homemade, savoury profiteroles! Contrary to our initial reaction, it turns out they were actually rather nice. We then shared broccoli tempura, chicken liver parfait and gurnard (our first experience of the fish) cooked with lardons – it certainly hit the spot. </p>

    <p class="paragraph--lead">Next stop was Hay-on-Wye, the historic market town famous for its secondhand book shops. We wandered the meandering streets of this quaint town, snaking our way up and down browsing bookstores and popping into little boutiques. </p>
    <p>The rain and wind continued and being right in the middle of the six nations it would have been a shame to not find a pub to cheer on the men in red. Unfortunately it wasn’t the outcome we had hoped for as Wales lost narrowly to Scotland. However it was a delight to soak up the atmosphere in a Welsh country pub with our neighbours, sharing welsh cakes and drinking Butty Bach.</p>
    <p>We made our way back to the hotel, where many Welsh were drowning their sorrows and watching Ireland vs Italy. We had booked into the hotel restaurant for the evening and both Toby and I had opted for steaks with peppercorn sauce, accompanied by a lovely bottle of Pinot Noir. Moving round to the snug sofas and open fire for a nightcap ended the night perfectly.</p>

    <p class="paragraph--lead">On Sunday morning we awoke to a familiar scene – but we had big plans for the day ahead so the British weather was not going to get in our way!</p>
    <p>Opting for a full English I couldn’t help scoffing a bowl of cereal as a starter and a croissant for dessert – the Welsh weather practically called for it. On the itinerary for the day was the Black Mountain Pass and a visit to the old market town of Brecon. </p>
    <hr />
    <h4 class="title title--italic title--smaller">Black Mountain Pass</h4>
    <p>We headed for Abercraf to begin the Black Mountain Pass drive, which we had been told was a drive not to be missed – boy, was everybody right! Even in the adverse weather conditions, as we wound along the tree-lined road, we were in awe as the expanse of the Brecon Beacons opened out in front of us. Myself, Toby, a few Brecon sheep, our MINI Countryman and a handful of DofE students had the beautiful Welsh mountains all to ourselves. </p>

    <p>The vast back drop, the craggy rocks and the running streams were a sight to behold, even though the elements were against us. We were determined to capture some photos of the scenery, so we took it in turns to run out the car and get blown around in an attempt to savour this moment.</p>

After browsing the boutique stores, we headed up to the cathedral for a wander around the grounds and then popped into the cafe for a tea and cake before our drive home.</p>

    <p>We had a great weekend in the Brecon Beacons whizzing around in our MINI Countryman. There is so much to do and see that we couldn't fit it into one weekend and we will certainly be heading back! Hopefully next time the sun might pay a visit so we can enjoy the Beacons by foot. We were dying to get out and explore the mountains and lakes and take in some fresh Brecon air – but I suppose it wouldn’t have been a proper British road trip without adverse weather!</p>
