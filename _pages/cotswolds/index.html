  - title: Broadway Tower
    class: broadway-tower
    location: Broadway, Worcestershire
    description: >

  - title: Cotswolds Distillery
    class: cotswolds-distillery
    location: Shipston-on-Stour

      This vast Norman Abbey seems wholly out of place in its immediate surrounds. Its scale dwarfs the village around it, and from its unique entrance arch to its vast tower, it stands as the finest example of Norman architecture in Britain. The vaulted ceiling is framed by a patchwork of luminous stained glass, creating a dramatic, breathtaking scene certainly worth visiting.
