roadtrip-title: Holme to Castleton
roadtrip-content: >
  <p>Start at the village of Holme, heading south on the A6024 toward Woodhead. As the hills begin to undulate, and the road twists around, you’ll be confronted with the Woodhead Reservoir, as you briefly join the A628 before veering left onto the B6105. As the road winds over the peaks, drop into Glossop, and go left at the main crossroads in town. As you leave suburbia, the Snake Pass opens in-front of you. A fitting title, the road meanders high and low, with nerve-wracking bends and stunning views. As you pass the Ladybower Reservoir, head left toward Hope Valley, then right toward Hope. At the village of Hope, Castleton is just a little further ahead. Instead, take a detour around Edale Road, for one last run of twists and turns before going left into picturesque Castleton, a fittingly beautiful destination to relax in and wind-down after a thrilling drive through the best of the Peaks. </p>

  - title: Buxton
    class: buxton
    feature: true
    location: Buxton, Derbyshire
    description: >
      Georgian Regency architecture frames this historic spa town, lauded as the capital of the Peak District – though, admittedly, just outside the border. Discover the Pavilion Gardens, and other Regency highlights like the Devonshire Dome, before perusing the local market (Tuesdays and Saturdays) and checking into a spa for a pampering.

  - title: Eyam
    class: eyam
    feature: true
    location: Eyam, Derbyshire
    description: >
      This charming village has a dark past. In an extraordinary tale of self sacrifice, the village quarantined itself after an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1665, thus saving the neighbouring area from the horrors of the plague. Its remarkable story is told in the museum, and in the graves and markings across the doomed village.

  - title: Bakewell
    class: bakewell
    location: Bakewell, Derbyshire
    description: >
      This quaint and picturesque village is the busiest in the Peak District, with a famous Monday market and distinctive cottages that set a glorious archaic tone to any visit. It’s also home to the Bakewell Pudding, and three shops all vie for the claim of holding the original recipe – as good an excuse as any to try all three!

  - title: Chatsworth House
    class: chatsworth-house
    location: Bakewell, Derbyshire
    description: >
      This grand stately home is an awe-inspiring place to visit, not only for its vast, opulent edifice, but also the cultural riches found within. Dubbed the Palace of the Peaks, it was also conversely the prison of Mary, Queen of Scots. Inside you’ll find a treasure trove of artworks, including portraits of the current Devonshires by Lucian Freud, and Damien Hirst’s sculpture, Exquisite Pain.

  - title: Peveril Castle
    class: peveril-castle
    location: Castleton, Derbyshire

    class: derwent-dam
    location: Upper Derwent Valley, Derbyshire
    description: >
      Not just a practicality, the Derwent Dam is a landmark oft photographed for the stunning valleys that surround it.

  - title: Speedwell Cavern
    class: speedwell-cavern
    location: Castleton, Derbyshire
    description: >
      Descend into the belly of the peaks, to find a boat waiting for you at the bottom. As you glide through the old lead mine through the narrowest of passages, you’ll find relief as the network opens out into a cathedral-like cavern, as you float above the ‘bottomless pit’. An eerie, enchanting experience not to be missed.

  - title: Haddon Hall
    class: haddon-hall
    location: Bakewell, Derbyshire
    description: >
      A treasure from the middle ages, Haddon Hall is resplendent in its remarkable preservation of age-old architecture. Its Elizabethan gardens only hint at the riches of its interior, a mesmerising glimpse at medieval stateliness.

  - title: Heights of Abraham
    class: heights-of-abraham
    location: Matlock, Derbyshire
    description: >
      At the edge of the Peak District, spoil yourself with panoramic views from a cable-car. As you descend the heights, explore the two caverns that will see you navigated deep under the hillside for an enthralling glance at the caves.
