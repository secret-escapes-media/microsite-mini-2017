    <p class="paragraph--lead">First stop Bakewell – a gorgeous little town situated right in the heart of the Peaks.</p>
    <p>After a pain free drive from Newbury, Emma (my wifey) and I were well and truly ready for lunch. As we were on holiday, we traded in a traditional lunch for the divine sweet treat that is the Bakewell Pudding. Having a pudding for lunch and the chance to sample this famous town’s namesake was a surprise treat. It was a million miles away from the white tart you know from the shops and certainly worth skipping lunch for. According to Mary at the local store: “20 seconds in the microwave makes all the difference!”</p>

    <p>Bakewell is a beautiful little town dotted with a charming mix of mainly independent shops. After a few cheeky purchases we headed towards Monsal Head, a picturesque viewpoint within an eight minute drive of Bakewell. The area is known for its view down the Wye Valley and the impressive viaduct which makes for an imposing scene. </p>

    <p>We arrived at the aptly named Monsal Head Hotel, which offered views over the famous landmark. </p>
    <p>We then spent the next two hours enjoying a lovely walk down the River Wye including some impressive waterfalls and quite stunning wildlife to boot. I wholeheartedly recommend this as a walk for anyone with two or three hours to kill.</p>
    <p>As 5pm hit we were greeted by a heavy snow shower, making it prime time to retreat to our hotel for the night – The Cavendish Hotel in Baslow. This tiny village sits on the River Derwent and borders the grand estate of Chatsworth House.</p>

    <h4 class="title title--italic title--smaller">The Cavendish</h4>
    <p>The Cavendish is a lovely little hotel and with only 15 rooms has a really intimate feel about it. Our room suited the classic heritage charm of the surrounding area, with sophisticated decor that made for a rich stay. It was no surprise, therefore, to learn that the Duchess of Devonshire had had a hand in the interior design. </p>
    <p>Heading for the bar after a long day, I went for a pint of Bakewell Best Bitter (made by the Peaks Brewery), whilst Emma got talked into a local Peaks gin and tonic.</p>
    <p>After a short while we were lead into The Gallery Restaurant, an intimate space with an open fire to shake off the chill of the weather. Highlights included scallop ceviche and a stunning roasted quail, each deliciously prepared.</p>

    <p>After a delightful Eggs Benedict we decided a quick walk would wake us up before an adventure in the MINI Countryman. The reception recommended walking the grounds of Chatsworth House – a short stroll turned into hours of exploring!</p>
    <p>Deer and sheep dotted the landscape which made for a truly magical stroll. The actual house itself is closed over winter but it didn’t detract from the experience. The Cavendish Family (and the Duke of Devonshire no less!) are lucky, lucky people.</p>

    <p>We set off in the MINI Countryman for Castleton. As we entered the town we were instantly hit by the towering snowy hill tops of Mam Tor in the background – it really was a unique place.</p>
    <p>After a short stroll I decided I had to conquer the imposing hillside. Emma didn’t seem convinced, but after arguing it was for the sake of a potentially epic view over Castleton (and even better photos) I managed to win her over. All said, it was an exhilarating climb, and imparted a drama only the Peaks can offer.</p>

    <p>Next we arrived at the beginning of the Winnats Pass. The pass was once thought to have originated from a giant cavern collapse, resulting in a winding trail that looked as if it had cut the mountain in two. Simply driving through it seemed a missed opportunity, so both myself and Emma donned our hiking boots and headed upward in the direction of the infamous Mam Tor.</p>
    <p>With snowfall getting thicker by the minute the view across the Peaks was very limited but I can imagine on a clear day it is incredible. That said, you could still see the winding stretch of the Pass, with the hills rolling away into the distance. This is certainly a great spot for a breather.</p>
    <p>With our lungs now firmly full of fresh air and our boots caked in snow it was time to wave the Peaks goodbye and move on to our next outdoor adventure – Cumbria was calling!</p>
