    <h4 class="title title--italic title--smaller">Bakewell</h4>
    <p>First stop Bakewell – a gorgeous little town situated right in the heart of the Peaks.</p>
    <p>After a pain free drive from Newbury, Emma (my wifey) and I were well and truly ready for lunch. As we were on holiday, we traded in a traditional lunch for the divine sweet treat that is the Bakewell Pudding. Having a pudding for lunch and the chance to sample this famous town’s namesake was a surprise treat. It was a million miles away from the white tart you know from the shops and certainly worth skipping lunch for. According to Mary at the local store: “20 seconds in the microwave makes all the difference!”</p>

    <p>Bakewell itself was a beautiful little town dotted with a charming mix of mainly independent shops. After a few cheeky shop purchases we headed towards Monsal Head, A famous beauty spot within an eight minute drive of Bakewell. The area is known for its view down the Wye Valley and the incredibly impressive viaduct which makes for an imposing scene. </p>

    <p>Emma and myself parked ourselves at The Monsal Head Hotel which quite aptly looked right over the famous landscape. </p>
    <p>We then spent the next two hours enjoying a lovely walk down at the base of the River Wye including some seriously impressive waterfalls and quite stunning wildlife to boot. I wholeheartedly recommend this as an ideal walk for anyone with two or three hours to kill.</p>
    <p>As 5pm hit we were greeted by a seriously heavy snow shower, making it prime time to retreat to our hotel for the night – The Cavendish Hotel in Baslow. This tiny village sits on the River Derwent and borders the grand estate of Chatsworth House.</p>

    <h4 class="title title--italic title--smaller">The Cavendish</h4>
    <p>The Cavendish is a lovely little Hotel and with only 15 rooms has a really intimate feel about it. Our room suited the classic heritage charms of the surrounding area, with sophisticated decor that made for a rich stay. It was no surprise, therefore, to learn that the Duchess of Devonshire had had a hand in the interior design. </p>
    <p>Heading for the bar after a long day, I went for a Pint of Bakewell Best Bitter (made by the Peaks Brewery), whilst Emma got talked into a local Peaks gin and tonic.</p>
    <p>After a small while we were lead into The Gallery Restaurant, a truly intimate space with an open fire to shake off the chill of the weather. Highlights included scallop ceviche and a stunning roasted quail, each deliciously prepared.</p>

  <div class="row--thin row--padding">
    <h4 class="title title--italic title--smaller">Chatsworth House</h4>
    <p>After a delightful Eggs Benedict we decided a quick walk would wake us up before an adventure in the MINI. The reception recommended walking the grounds of Chatsworth House – a short stroll turned into hours of exploring!</p>
    <p>Deer and Sheep dotted the landscape which made for a truly magical stroll. The actual House itself is closed over Winter but it didn’t seem to detract from the experience. The Cavendish Family (and the Duke of Devonshire no less!) are lucky, lucky people.</p>

    <p>We set off in the Countryman for Castleton. As we entered the town we were instantly hit by the towering snowy hill tops of Mam Tor in the background – it really was a unique place. After a short stroll, I was convinced I had to conquer the imposing hillside – arguing it was for the sake of a potentially epic view over Castleton, and even better photos, Emma didn’t seem convinced. After managing to win her over, the weather broke and the snow fell as a sour chord struck her face! All said, it was an exhilarating climb, and imparted a drama only the Peaks can offer.</p>

    <h4 class="title title--italic title--smaller">Winnats Pass</h4>
    <p>Next we arrived at the beginning of the Winnats Pass. The pass was once thought to have originated from a giant cavern collapse, resulting in a winding trail that looked as if it had cut the mountain in two.</p>
    <p>Simply driving through it seemed a missed opportunity so both myself and Emma donned our pair of hiking boots and headed upward in the direction of the infamous Mam Tor. With snowfall getting thicker by the minute the view was across the Peaks was fairly (very) limited but I can imagine on a clear day it is incredible. That said, you could still see the winding stretch of the Pass, with the hills rolling away into the distance. This is certainly a great spot for a breather.</p>
